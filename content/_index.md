## "But I‚Äôm already fine, I don‚Äôt need healing."

Everyone is damanged by their parents in one way or another. That's why queer healing is for everyone.  There's an opportunitiy for even the most "healthy" of us to heal in ways that we didn't even know we were broken.

For me, the breakthroughs in healing as an adult have all started when I humbly began to question a lot of assumptions I had long made about myself (the biggest one being, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm already fine‚Äù). This process of self-inquiry has helped me gradually uncover the parts of myself that were long suppressed.

One of the pernicious things about childhood trauma is that it can stay with you for so long that you completely believe it‚Äôs part of who you are. Maybe you don‚Äôt even remember the time when we weren‚Äôt traumatized.

I don‚Äôt mean to make you paranoid. My point is, even if you feel fully healed, you may still get something out of the resources here. It certainly won‚Äôt hurt.



## Coming out

Coming out of the closet is not a singular moment where the hero fabulously steps out on stage, loudly and confidently proclaiming their truth. It‚Äôs a lifelong journey of self-discovery, acceptance, and sharing. It begins with learning to accept an inner truth about yourself, and over time the decision to accept and share this truth ripples through many parts of your life. There are many discoveries to be made about yourself, too. Queerphobia is so widespread that most people discover over time the ways they have bought into and internalized society's phobias, evne unconsciously. This process of rewiring the phobias is a process of learning to celebrate and love parts of ourselves we were taught to hate, or to believe was unnatural, evil, against God, and so on.

### Internalized queerphobia is often unconscious

Most queer people in the world have been programmed by society about what it means to be queer. The messages that are most hateful are usually the easiest ones to spot within ourselves. [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98ApKUqb-RQ) to see someone beginning to notice and come to terms with their own unconscious queerphobias.

## Mental Health

> ‚ÄúYou can be fully in charge of your life only if you can acknowledge the reality of your body, in all its visceral dimensions.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî Bessel van der Kolk, ‚ÄúThe Body Keeps the Score‚Äù

PTSD and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are more common among queer people. Internalized queerphobias are also common and often unconscious. In recent years, we have come a long way in understanding how to help people heal more effectively. Here are some directions and avenues where deeper healing can take place. 

### EMDR Therapy
[The Body Keeps the Score](https://www.amazon.com/Body-Keeps-Score-Healing-Trauma/dp/0143127748/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0143127748&pd_rd_r=E77WSHZ3GQWMTJGADVET&pd_rd_w=A0qUV&pd_rd_wg=lJoLK&psc=1&refRID=E77WSHZ3GQWMTJGADVET&dpID=51HZpvdVMjL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=detail) by Bessel van der Kolk talks about the power of EMDR and somatic therapies for treating PTSD  
[Parnell Institute](http://parnellemdr.com/) is a list of EMDR therapists   

### Somatic Experiencing
Somatic Experiencing is a body-oriented approach to PTSD healing. It attempts to promote awareness and release physical tension that remains in the aftermath of trauma.

### Psychadelics
There‚Äôs a growing belief that psychadelics, when used in therapy or with a guide, are among the fastest and most effective treatments for complex PTSD. But they come with risks. This is an area of ongoing exploration and recent expiermentation.

### Neurofeedback
Neurofeedback uses EEG monitoring to improve brain functioning as you learn to alter your brain activity. By using computer imaging, you receive direct feedback through a ‚Äúbrain map‚Äù that indicates areas of your brain with excessive activity associated with PTSD, such as your fear centers. Here you learn how to relax your body and mind to activate the outermost layer of your brain; that which is associated with thinking and decision-making. Typically, 20 sessions will give you enough feedback to understand how to facilitate regulation of your body and mind on your own.

### Keto diet
Could be promising for PTSD, but there's not a whole lot of research here.

Either way, it seems [good for the brain](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/diagnosis-diet/201706/ketogenic-diets-psychiatric-disorders-new-2017-review).

### Drawing
In the act of drawing, the patient makes an initial reorganisation of the form of the trauma, and begins to differentiate the adaptive ego, which has the tools and the ability to restructure the experiences, and the traumatic emotional part that suffers those experiences in a condition of impotence and passivity. The person may rapidly access preverbal and motor-sensory language, activating inborn creative skills. The use of this tool enables us to access the traumatic material gently, limiting dissociative reactions, bypassing avoidance and flight behaviour and setting a distance from pain by objectivizing. A protective space is created between the self and the part that holds the suffering. A voice to the inner child. The patient is offered the possibility of drawing what is occurring in the self's here and now, and given a choice of different graphic materials. At the end of the drawing and assessment phase the person is asked to note what has emerged, and a brief space of time may be allowed for description without interpretation.

### Meditation & Spirituality
Meditation is very powerful and can be used to [reduce the symptoms of PTSD](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201601/meditation-reduces-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-symptoms) by calming the nervous system.

### Breath Work and Cold Exposure
It seems so simple but breath work and cold exposure can be very powerful for healing. For example, reducing inflammation via cold exposure can be incredibly helpful for depression.

### Religion & Spirituality
There is a lot of religious shame and oppression. If you‚Äôre religious, does this mean you have to stop being religious? No. There are lots of options for you, and many inclusive churches and spiritual communities.
