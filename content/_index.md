The purpose of this page is to provide a 'healing menu' for any LGBTQIA+ person or ally.  
The goal is to help you move from surviving to thriving.  
Some of this is San Francisco Bay Area specific.  
We hope to expand to other areas in the future.

## Trauma and Recovery
PTSD and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are more common among LGBTQIA+ folks. In recent years, we have come a long way in understanding how to help people heal more effectively. Here are some directions and avenues where deeper healing can take place.

### Psychadelics
There’s a growing belief that psychadelics are among the fastest and most effective treatments for complex PTSD. But they come with risks. 

Around the world there are healers, guides, and sitters who can be with you for a healing ceremony using mushrooms, Ayahuasca, MDMA, and other plant and synthetic medicines. You’ll have to dig around a bit to find them.

## Trauma Sensitive Yoga

[KELSEY GUSTAFSON](http://kelseygustafson.com/)

## Neurofeedback
Neurofeedback uses EEG monitoring to improve brain functioning as you learn to alter your brain activity. By using computer imaging, you receive direct feedback through a “brain map” that indicates areas of your brain with excessive activity associated with PTSD, such as your fear centers. Here you learn how to relax your body and mind to activate the outermost layer of your brain; that which is associated with thinking and decision-making. Typically, 20 sessions will give you enough feedback to understand how to facilitate regulation of your body and mind on your own.

## Keto diet
Could be promising for PTSD, but there's not a whole lot of research here.  
[PTSD UK](https://www.ptsduk.org/ketogenic-diet/) | [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8r02yz/my_psychiatrist_recommended_keto_to_help_control/)  
Either way, it seems [good for the brain](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/diagnosis-diet/201706/ketogenic-diets-psychiatric-disorders-new-2017-review).

## Drawing
In the act of drawing, the patient makes an initial reorganisation of the form of the trauma, and begins to differentiate the adaptive ego, which has the tools and the ability to restructure the experiences, and the traumatic emotional part that suffers those experiences in a condition of impotence and passivity. The person may rapidly access preverbal and motor-sensory language, activating inborn creative skills. The use of this tool enables us to access the traumatic material gently, limiting dissociative reactions, bypassing avoidance and flight behaviour and setting a distance from pain by objectivizing. A protective space is created between the self and the part that holds the suffering. A voice to the inner child. The patient is offered the possibility of drawing what is occurring in the self's here and now, and given a choice of different graphic materials. At the end of the drawing and assessment phase the person is asked to note what has emerged, and a brief space of time may be allowed for description without interpretation.

## Meditation & mindfulness
Meditation is very powerful and is used for to heal emotional trauma.

## Breath Work and Cold Exposure
It seems so simple but breath work and cold exposure can be very powerful for healing. For example, reducing inflammation via cold exposure can be incredibly helpful for depression.
