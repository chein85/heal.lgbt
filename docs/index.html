<h2 id="coming-out">Coming out</h2>

<p>Coming out of the closet is not a singular moment where the hero fabulously steps out on stage, loudly and confidently proclaiming their truth. It’s a lifelong journey of self-discovery, acceptance, and sharing. It begins with learning to accept an inner truth about yourself, and over time the decision to accept and share this truth ripples through many parts of your life. There are many discoveries to be made about yourself, too. Queerphobia is so widespread that most people discover over time the ways they have bought into and internalized society&rsquo;s phobias, evne unconsciously. This process of rewiring the phobias is a process of learning to celebrate and love parts of ourselves we were taught to hate, or to believe was unnatural, evil, against God, and so on.</p>

<h4 id="internalized-queerphobia-can-be-unconscious">Internalized queerphobia can be unconscious</h4>

<p>Most queer people in the world have been programmed by society about what it means to be queer. This stuff is deeply wired into us. The messages that are most hateful are usually the easiest ones to spot within ourselves, but there are subtler phobias that are harder for us to become aware of. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98ApKUqb-RQ">Watch this video</a> to see someone beginning to notice and come to terms with their own unconscious queerphobias.</p>

<h2 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>“You can be fully in charge of your life only if you can acknowledge the reality of your body, in all its visceral dimensions.”<br />
— Bessel van der Kolk, “The Body Keeps the Score”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No matter how loving and well-intentioned our childhood home was (or is), we all emerge from childhood damaged by our parents, by our schooling, and by society in one way or another. Which means there&rsquo;s an opportunitiy for even the most &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; of us to heal in ways that we didn&rsquo;t even know we were broken.</p>

<p>Everyone has emotional trauma in their past. A negative memory that you keep returning to. Sometimes it&rsquo;s simply the sense that you cannot seem to get out of your head, that your mind is on overdrive all the time and you can&rsquo;t focus, or that you often feel unsafe or triggered. If a negative memory is something that you think should be &ldquo;no big deal,&rdquo; that you believe shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, and that you wish you could just get over, but it keeps coming up, that is trauma.</p>

<p>Some people have a history of trauma with a lowercase t. Some have Trauma with a capital T. Some have both going on. It&rsquo;s possible to heal from all kinds of trauma. A few lowercase-t traumas spread out throughout childhood can be more debilitating than one capital-T trauma.</p>

<p>Trauma, PTSD and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childabuseandneglect/acestudy/index.html">adverse childhood experiences (ACEs)</a> are more common among queer people. Internalized queerphobias are also common and often unconscious. In recent years, we have come a long way in understanding how to help people heal more effectively. Here are some directions and avenues where deeper healing can take place.</p>

<p>One of the pernicious things about childhood trauma is that it can be with you for so long that you come to believe it’s part of who you are.</p>

<p>Therapy means so many things. There are many kinds of therapists. So, it&rsquo;s worth learning about various modalities (there are many) and talking to several therapists so that your work will be effective. With the wrong kind of therapy, it&rsquo;s easy to waste a lot of money. But the right kind of therapy is absolutely life changing and is worth every penny.</p>

<h3 id="emdr-therapy">EMDR Therapy</h3>

<p>EMDR is used for PTSD, depression, anxiety, addiction, and phobias. It is different from talk therapy. It uses eye movement (or sounds or vibrations). When you recall a traumatic memory while doing these calming eye movements, the memory gradually loses its charge.</p>

<p>No one knows quite why it works, but the eye movement is similar to what happens during deep sleep. The theory is that trauma is stored in the part of the brain that isn&rsquo;t accessible via talking, so while talk therapy may feel good at the time, it doesn&rsquo;t always have a lasting impact. EMDR makes it possible to truly heal old trauma, sometimes in just a few sessions.</p>

<h3 id="somatic-experiencing">Somatic Experiencing</h3>

<p>Somatic Experiencing is a body-oriented approach to PTSD healing. It attempts to promote body awareness and release the residual physical tension that remains in the aftermath of trauma. It is sometimes used in combination with EMDR.</p>

<h3 id="psychadelics">Psychadelics</h3>

<p>There’s a growing belief that psychadelics, when used in therapy or with a guide, are among the fastest and most effective treatments for complex PTSD. But they come with risks. This is an area of ongoing exploration and recent expiermentation.</p>

<h3 id="neurofeedback">Neurofeedback</h3>

<p>Neurofeedback uses EEG monitoring to improve brain functioning as you learn to alter your brain activity. By using computer imaging, you receive direct feedback through a “brain map” that indicates areas of your brain with excessive activity associated with PTSD, such as your fear centers. Here you learn how to relax your body and mind to activate the outermost layer of your brain; that which is associated with thinking and decision-making. Typically, 20 sessions will give you enough feedback to understand how to facilitate regulation of your body and mind on your own.</p>

<h3 id="keto-diet">Keto diet</h3>

<p>Could be promising for PTSD, but there&rsquo;s not a whole lot of research here.<br />

Either way, it seems <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/diagnosis-diet/201706/ketogenic-diets-psychiatric-disorders-new-2017-review">good for the brain</a>.</p>

<h3 id="drawing">Drawing</h3>

<p>In the act of drawing, the patient makes an initial reorganisation of the form of the trauma, and begins to differentiate the adaptive ego, which has the tools and the ability to restructure the experiences, and the traumatic emotional part that suffers those experiences in a condition of impotence and passivity. The person may rapidly access preverbal and motor-sensory language, activating inborn creative skills. The use of this tool enables us to access the traumatic material gently, limiting dissociative reactions, bypassing avoidance and flight behaviour and setting a distance from pain by objectivizing. A protective space is created between the self and the part that holds the suffering. A voice to the inner child. The patient is offered the possibility of drawing what is occurring in the self&rsquo;s here and now, and given a choice of different graphic materials. At the end of the drawing and assessment phase the person is asked to note what has emerged, and a brief space of time may be allowed for description without interpretation.</p>

<h2 id="diy-healing">DIY Healing</h2>

<p>Can&rsquo;t afford a therapist right now? There are many ways to get free therapy, so don&rsquo;t give up the search. You can go to a training clinic at a university, for a reduced rate. If you&rsquo;re in the US, you may be able to use Medicaid. Call <a href="https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/">SAMHSA</a> at 800.662.4357 to speak with someone, confidentially, who can help you find options.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a lot you can do on your own.</p>
