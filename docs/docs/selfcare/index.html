<h2 id="self-care-pro-tips">Self-care PRO TIPS!!</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Yoga,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;You should do some yoga it will be great.&rdquo;<br />
Whatever. I have better things to do.<br />
Not worth my time.<br />
Downright silly.<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a yoga person,&rdquo; you say.</p>

<p>And then, when you finally get out of your own way and take a yoga class, you&rsquo;re like.. omg I feel so much better why didn&rsquo;t I do that all along?</p>

<p>A lot of self-care can feel that way.</p>

<p>Or, worse, self-care can be triggering because we don&rsquo;t want to see how we&rsquo;ve neglected ourselves. How lost we&rsquo;ve allowed ourselves to become. If I really look at my finances&hellip; then I will have to face how awful they look and I&rsquo;m not ready for that! Ugh.</p>

<p>Self-care also takes time. It happens at a slower pace than we might be used to. It requires some diligence. If there&rsquo;s a lot of anxiety in your life, slowing down may not be easy. It may be the last thing you want to do. EVEN if you think it could really help.</p>

<p>Self-care asks that we be present, stop running, come into our bodies and pay attention to our health. And maybe we don&rsquo;t like what we see. Maybe there was a lot of neglectâ€”years of neglect. It&rsquo;s easier to keep running.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s best to start simple. One day I decided to start making sure my feet were happy. I discovered that I had been buying size 12 shoes but my feet were actually size 13. So I bought some shoes that fit, for once. I started moisturizing my feet before bed. I got a little pumice stone and started to exfoliate them in the shower. I got cute colorful socks I liked. I started clipping my toenails a bit more often. And now I know that no matter what kind of crazy shit is going on in my life, my feet are taken care of.</p>

<p>Self-care is a thousand tiny things that can elevate your mood and overall sense of wellbeing. None of them may seem particularly important, but they add up.</p>

<h2 id="take-care-of-your-face">Take care of your face</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with your face.</p>

<p>Every night, wash your face before bed.</p>

<p>Every morning, follow these three steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Splash your face with water</li>
<li>Moisturize</li>
<li>Sunscreen</li>
</ol>

<p>What products should you buy for this? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction">/r/skincareaddiction</a> is a very useful subreddit. The short answer is, try different products and listen to your skin.</p>

<p>In fact, a lot of self-care comes down to listening to yourself in ways you may not be accustomed to, and simply responding to what you ntoice.</p>
